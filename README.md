# PEP-edits
Documentation of all changes I've made to the Phylogeny Explorer Project (PEP) since being added on 29/10/2018

## Code
- All changes will be documented in .md files with screengrabs if necessary
- A file structure based off date or clade will be implented when needed

## Issues
- Issues or bugs I've found while browsing the PEP
- Stories/tickets I've been given to work on

## Projects
There will be a separate project boards for development and data entry. Both will use the Kanban system to track:
- tickets I plan to work on
- are currently working on
- and done from my perspective
